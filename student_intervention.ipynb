    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea in choosing the model is to start with simple ones that might perform somewhat well on the data and move to more complicated ones (Occam's Razor). Also, diversity is important to make sure we are looking at the problem from different angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "K-Nearest neighbors have been used in [behavioral targeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Applications) to predict, for example, which ad is most likely to be clicked by a customer, based on previous activity of himself and others.\n",
    "Being non-parametric, K-Nearest Neighbors can approximate arbitrarily complex functions (given enough data). It can deal with multiclass problems without needing any adjustment and can incorporate special domain knowledge by using a distance function tailored to the problem.\n",
    "K-NN is a lazy learner, which means that almost no effort is done until we are prompted to estimate something. This is advantageous in settings where training the model is more common than querying it, but disadvantageous in the opposite scenario. Also, K-NN does not work well in high-dimensional problems due to the Curse of Dimensionality, although we can mitigate this using by dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected K-NN because the low-dimension embedding of the data suggested that there were some clusters for students that did not pass. (And also because I was curious about the structure of the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "Decision Trees are useful for [credit-scoring](http://www.knowledgetaiwan.org/ojs/index.php/ijbi/article/download/77/35), among [other applications](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html), and are known for the ease of training on large datasets, capability of handling both numerical and categorical data, extensibility for multiclass problems, dealing with nonlinear decision boundaries and interpretability.\n",
    "The problem with decision trees is that they too much attention to the data and tend to produce very complicated decision boundaries (overfitting), specially when classes are not axis-aligned. Prunning may be employed, but it may become difficult for the prunned tree to explain the training data effectively.\n",
    "Decision Trees are a good starting point for the problem as they offer some insight into the data, are quick to train and, after hyper-parameter selection, can become good baseline models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is a good candidate for the problem because we don't have to worry about having both numeric and categorical features or even feature scaling and both training and predicting should be fast. Also, we can inspect the model to see if it matches our understanding of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest\n",
    "Random Forest have received a lot of attention in the field of [computer vision](http://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/frintrop_simone//BVW13/BVW-gall.pdf) to predict, for example, handwritten digits or facial features in a face photograph.\n",
    "Random Forests are very versatile, performing well on a variety of problems and offer a good starting point when not much is known about the data. They are able achieve balance between bias and variance by using bagging and attribute bagging for each tree that is built (which reduces correlation between trees).\n",
    "Another key aspect of Random Forests is their capability of dealing with unimportant features, which turns to be a problem with Decision Trees (see above). Some even use them solely for [feature selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection-as-part-of-a-pipeline)!\n",
    "Unfortunately, they are not as interpretable as decision trees: it is possible to see what features the model consider important, but that is all. Also, Random Forest will struggle with classes that are not axis-aligned (as Decision Trees do) or when the data is sparse (because of attribute bagging).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is a good candidate for the problem reasons similar to those of Decision Trees (interpretability to a lesser degree) with the advantages of increased predictive capacity and built-in feature selection mechanism."

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Before we dive into the analysis, consider this: a model will be trained once in a while, but, after trained, will be used to make thousands (even more) predictions. Prediction time dominates the cost and will be the only one considered when choosing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate costs, we first need to estimate usage. According to [this](http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1651/2774), the average MOOC enroll around **43,000** students and has a typical length is 8-10 weeks. If we run our predictions on every enrolled student on a weekly basis, we will make a total of **344,000 predictions** for that course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one to be ruled out is K-NN:\n",
    "- Prediction time is the biggest of chosen models\n",
    "- Score is much lower than Random Forest on both training and testing sets. The important metric is, of course, the testing score, but training score gives us an upper boundary to the testing score we can achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide between Decision Trees and Random Forest, we should first analyze the costs.\n",
    "- Decision Tree is faster than Random Forest (3-4x times faster when predicting). it would take about **0.7 seconds** (344000 * 0.0006 / 300) to make all predictions. Translating that time to costs, on a `c4.xlarge` EC2 instance, the cost of running this predictions would be only a fraction of a cent. So, both the costs of Decision Trees and Random Forests are negligible\n",
    "- When compared to Random Forest, the F<sub>1</sub> score decreased by 0.25165 units. which is a lot! This means failing to take action on students that will likely abandon the course or unnecessarily tending to \"good\" students.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with `Random Forest`, our winner. We make a conscious choice of trading predicting speed and interpretability of decision trees to achieve better predictions with RF. Also, the only one that fared better than the Naive Predictor."
